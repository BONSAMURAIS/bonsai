## Repositories for BONSAI ontology
1. [BONSAI- ontology-RDF-framework](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/BONSAI-ontology-RDF-framework) - Discussions on how ontology was developed. Includes examples in .ttl and xml format for what the data should look like. Links to published ontology [ontology.bonsai.uno/core#](ontology.bonsai.uno/core#) as well as URIs to be used for time intervals, activity type...etc. The figure below shows the graphical representation of the BONSAI ontology. All data in BONSAI is transformed to RDF using the concepts defined in the BONSAI ontology. 
2. [ontology](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/ontology)- Code to publish the core ontology for BONSAI to the web [ontology.bonsai.uno/core#](ontology.bonsai.uno/core#).

## RDF conversion, data, storage
1. [arborist](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/arborist) - Creates .ttl files of the meta data in Exiobase and other data sources based on an ontology. Designed to work with BONSAI ontology. 
2. [rdf](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/rdf) - Contains .ttl files generated by arborist. All .ttl files can also be accessed from [here](rdf.bonsai.uno).
3. [importer](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/importer)- This repository imports data in RDF format and loads it into the triplestore.
4. [triple-store](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/triple-store) - A triple-store is where RDF data is loaded and can be queried from. This repository contains competency queries and information related to the Bonsai RDF triple-store backend: [Jena triplestore](https://odas.aau.dk/fuseki/bonsai/query)

## Correspondence tables
1. [Correspondence-tables](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/Correspondence-tables) - Contains correspondence tables that systematically explains where, and to what extent, the categories in one classification may be found in other classifications, or in earlier versions of the same classification. Also includes code to convert the corresponding tables to .ttl files.
2. [LCIA_Module](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/LCIA_Module) - Contains correspondence tables for impact assessment (charactherization factors) and converts in RDF format for entry into the database.

## Exiobase conversion
1. [Exiobase-conversion-software](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/Exiobase-conversion-software) - Contains scripts for conversion of Exiobase to RDF in .nt files. 
2. [mojo](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/mojo) - Applies system model frame work to SUT data in RDF format. Turns the raw data into a computational structure (Hybrid Supply and Use data to Input Output data). The computational structure is converted to RDF and returned to the triplestore (scripts need to be updated)

## Web Application
1. [bonsai_api](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai_api) - Aims to develop user friendly interface to query RDF data. Uses REST API endpoints to query the BONSAI database using POST and GET methods.

## Auxillary repositories
1. [bentso](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bentso) - Aims to collect annual data from European electricity via ENTSO-E API and convert it to RDF format using BONSAI ontology.
2. [beebee](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/beebee) - Conversion utility to parse BONSAI resolved database dumps for Brightway2
