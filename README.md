Welcome to the **management and documentation repository** for the Bonsai organisation (named _Bonsamurais_ on GitHub).

This repository hosts **[the Wiki](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/wiki)** which describes all components of the Bonsai modular software architecture (work-in-progress!). This prominent README document describes how to get started with Bonsai.

If you're a potential Bonsai **developer/contributor**: you're in the right place. There are many ways to contribute. This page will try to effectively direct your energies. Not sure if you want to contribute? [See here!](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai#why-contribute).

Fo potential Bonsai **user**, we currently do not have ready-to-use tools. Parts of an alpha version of the required software were developed during the [hackathon](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/hackathon-2019) in March 29th 2019. Development is currently ongoing as described below. 

## Which projects or tasks currently require contributions?
During the hackathon, see [the overview project board](https://github.com/orgs/BONSAMURAIS/projects/2)

## Where are the current priorities listed?
The [project dependencies image](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/hackathon-2019/blob/master/project-dependencies.png) may help with prioritisation.

## What is the current development status?
The Bonsai project is currently undergoing an intense period of organisation and development, since [~February 22nd 2019](https://bonsai.groups.io/g/hackathon2019/topics?p=RecentPostDate%2FSticky,,,20,1,0,0). It is presently in pre-alpha, with no usable tools or software released. Check again on March 29th!

## How to communicate with other developers?
See [BEP0004](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/enhancements/blob/bep4-communications/beps/0004-bonsai-communication-strategy.md), which describes the knowledge management and internal communication strategy of the organisation.

The [Bonsai Slack Workspace](https://bonsai-open.slack.com) is in active usage during planned hackathons.

## What do we mean when we say 'Bonsai'?
The term _Bonsai_ (**b**ig **o**pen **n**etwork **o**f **s**ustainability **a**ssessment **i**nformation) is used within the community for various related concepts. The BONSAI association is a non-profit headquartered in Denmark. The _big open network_ extends well-beyond this organisation, to include the volunteers, digital artefacts, concepts and processes which constitute the full Bonsai project. Core software modules may also be referred to collectively as _Bonsai_, although the boundaries of correct usage here are not yet final or formalised.

## Where is Bonsai described?
The most up-to-date consensus description of the Bonsai project are available on this Wiki.
High-level descriptions which are not expected to continuously change are available at the [Bonsai website](https://bonsai.uno/). Note that the tasks and planning on the Wiki supercede the static [work plan](https://bonsai.uno/strategy-work-plan/) hosted on the website.
An authoritative description of the existing Bonsai-related functionality can be found within the source code and associated documentation in the various repositories under the [Bonsai GitHub orgasnisation](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS). 

## Do you have a code-of-conduct?
Yes! All participation is subject to the [BONSAI code of conduct](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Where is the decision-making process described?
A proposal for using Python-style Bonsai enhancement proposals (BEPs) [has been made](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/enhancements/blob/master/beps/0002-bonsai-project-community-governance-structure.md) and is [under discussion.](https://bonsai.groups.io/g/main/topic/bep0002_proposal_open_for/30399914?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,1,0,30399914). The organisation Chair Chris Mutel has blogged about his thoughts on this topic [here](https://chris.mutel.org/bonsai-governance.html)

## Where is the documentation?
The documentation will be written alongside the code. An overview of the different repositories produced for bonsai can be found [here](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/blob/master/repositories_overview.md)

## Does Bonsai need translators?
Not yet.

## Expected/useful knowledge for contributors
There are many ways to conribute, which require different knowledge and skills, mostly relating to software development. Some general knowledge areas that are useful for all contribution forms are suggested here.
### GitHub
As a distributed collaborative open-source project, we have chosen GitHub for our version control management and project management (decision pending). To contribute source code, you will need to understand the [standard GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). To help with task management and organisation, familiarity with the usage of [Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) will help.

### Sustainability Assessments 
The _sai_ in _Bonsai_ stands for _sustainability assessment information_. Most contributors have a background connected to [Lifecycle Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment) (LCA) and/or [environmentally extended input-output analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_extended_input-output_analysis) (EIOA). High-level decision making requires knowledge of this context. However vital low-level contributions do not require this background knowledge.

### Resource Description Framework
The W3C standard [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) is used for modelling knowledge and brings numerous benefits (such as allowing to link different data sources consistently). This is related to Linked Data, and the Semantic Web. Understanding RDF will help you to understand what makes Bonsai unique and potentially very powerful. The final two sets of presentation slides of [this Web Fundamentals course](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/WebFundamentals/semantic-web/) are a good starting point and contain links to many other resources. 

Additional background information on open issues at the interface between LCA and Open Data are available [here](https://chris.mutel.org/next-steps.html#id2) and [here](https://lca-net.com/blog/next-step-open-lca-data/).

## Why contribute?
We assume that you recognise the importance of sustainability assessments: to create a world which is more sustainable - society must have a scientifically-grounded understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and processes. But why should you put your efforts into the Bonsai project specifically? 
Sustainability assessment, and life cycle assessment (LCA) in particular, is to a large extent built on cathedrals - large background databases, erected by the efforts of many people over a long period of time, but which are now both expensive and exclusive, and whose gatekeepers limit access to both the data and decisions on its management. [BONSAI](https://bonsai.uno/) believes in another model, a [bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) where the entire community can contribute to data generation, validation, and management decisions. We strongly feel that an open database is more transparent and more reproducible, and therefore the only option for the science of life cycle assessment. Such databases are also a prerequisite for LCA studies being used to support democratic decision making.
