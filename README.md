# Pieces of Code for BONSAI-beta version

The functional and technical specifications of BONSAI are described in the wiki:
https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/wiki

This repository contains pieces of code which could be used in the BONSAI beta-version.

[Input Output Framework](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/wiki/Harvest%20Data#sut-gap-filling--correction-routines)  
Data filling algorithm -> Least square method tutorial - overdetermined system resolution.ipynb  

[Global Impact Assessment](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/wiki/Ensure%20Data%20Quality#global-impact-assessment-ia)  
Calculation of Product Footprints -> Calculation of LCIA results - with Stepwise 1.6.ipynb

[Product System algorithms](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/wiki/Make-Data-Usable#product-system-algorithms)  
Matrix inversion -> Leontief inverse tutorial - calculate terminated results.ipynb

These tutorials are written for the Exiobase IO-database. This database is not open-source and cannot be uploaded from this site.
We intend to modify the tutorials to be able to use them with FORWAST which is an open-source database.

This code works with Python 3.4, it requires some additional packages such as Numpy and Pandas.
