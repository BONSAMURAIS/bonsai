# How to use it

Be C=1,..,m and K=1,...,n two arbitrary calssifications.

Be S(m,n) a correspondence table between the two classifications. S(i,j)=1 if the i-th category of classification C matches with the j-th category of classification K.

Multiplying any vector accounted in one or the other classification by the correspondence table, it is possible to change the classification
